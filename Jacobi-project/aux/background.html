<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The algorithm used in this program solves Laplace’s equation on an evenly spaced grid through the use of a simple Jacobi iteration technique. The equation is a partial differential equation named after Pierre-Simon Laplace and are important in many fields of science: namely the fields of electromagnetism, astronomy and fluid dynamics. The physical interpretation of the equations is they describe the behavior of potentials.</p>
<p>The equation has the form: <img src="./jacobiEq1.jpg" alt="Equation 1" /></p>
<p>A practical solution to this equation is the use of a Jacobi iteration that employs numerical second derivatives. Lets assume that we would like to know the state of heat flow across a metal surface where the source is coming from one of the corners of the square surface.</p>
<p>To tackle this, we would set up a two dimensional grid to represent the surface, and we will divide it evenly into square regions. We can simulate the heat source by defining the boundary conditions along the sides of the grid. In this case, we will be setting the bottom left corner to 100.0 and with an increasing gradient toward the other corners until it is zero. Once these conditions are set, the algorithm will use numerical solutions to the second derivatives in each direction to update the current matrix elements. And although we won’t check for convergence, the flow of the surface will eventually hit a steady-state.</p>
<h3 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h3>
<p>Following is a high-level description of the algorithm you will be implementing. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the grid that will result from the algorithm.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Allocate and specify a 2D array defining an evenly spaced grid of square dimension. You will need to leave space for the boundaries, as they do not belong to the main grid (i.e. a 1024 x 1024 matrix would need to be allocated as 1026x1026 to leave room for the borders.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup the initial constant boundary conditions. The value at the lower left hand corner of the of the grid will be fixed at 100.00, and the value ascending and to the right will be set to a linear gradient reaching zero at the opposite corners (see Figure 1). The rest of the borders will be fixed at zero. Please note, these boundaries will remain constant throughout the simulation.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup the initial condition of the inner grid elements as 0.5.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin and continue for a fixed number of cycles the iterative process. At each iteration, the value of each inner matrix element needs to be recomputed from elements of the current iteration. The updating formula, based on numerical computation of second derivatives, is:</p>
